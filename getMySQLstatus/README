getMySQLstatus

In order to obtain status information from the MySQL we need to be able to obtain information from inside the MySQL Server. In this example, we are using the debian-sys-maint user. 

The user will login, and dump the information to a file that can be read by the Zabbix agent. 

The password for the debian-sys-maint user is saved in clear text (permission restricted to root). In order to read this file the following changes need to be made to the sudoers file.

Cmnd_Alias READMYSQL = /bin/grep password /etc/mysql/debian.cnf 
zabbix ALL = NOPASSWD: READMYSQL

getValue.py
Returns a single value from a tab delimited file based on a key word search. Example read through the file created by getMySQLstatus.
